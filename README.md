# My Web Development Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects in web development, focusing on **Cypress**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **React**.
 Cypress is primarily designed for end-to-end testing of web applications, which includes both the frontend user interface (UI) and the backend API interactions.

With Cypress, you can write tests that cover the entire application flow, from interacting with the UI elements to making API requests and validating the responses. This makes Cypress a versatile tool that allows you to test the integration between the UI and the API.
